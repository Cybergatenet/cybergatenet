###👋 Hi, I’m Engr. Abel (Cybergate)

# I am a full stack software engineer with a strong engineering mindset. I work at the intersection of software development, embedded systems, cyber-security and applied computing, building solutions that solve real problems and scale beyond demos.

My interests span backend development, data analysis, system design, cybersecurity and hardware–software integration. I enjoy turning abstract ideas into working systems, whether that’s a data pipeline, an intelligent control system, or a research-driven prototype.

## 🧠 What I have Worked On

Full Stack Applications
Event Management System
Software engineering and system design
Embedded systems and microcontroller-based projects
Data analysis and automation
Applied AI and intelligent systems
Academic and engineering research projects

I care about clarity, correctness, and maintainability. Code should be readable, predictable, and purposeful.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Embedded solutions for agriculture, surveillance, and power management
Data-driven analysis and forecasting
Undergraduate-level engineering and computer science research works

Most repositories here are practical, learning-focused, and built to demonstrate how things actually work under the hood.

## 📈 Philosophy

I value:

Clean, well-documented code
Understanding fundamentals before abstractions
Building things that can be tested, explained, and improved

If it doesn’t work reliably or can’t be explained clearly, it’s not finished.
